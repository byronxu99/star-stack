# Closed-Form Matting and Astrophotography
Final project for 6.815 Digital and Computational Photography, Spring 2019.

## About
This is a C++ implementation of the Closed-Form Image Matting algorithm by [Levin, Lischinski, and Weiss](https://webee.technion.ac.il/people/anat.levin/papers/Matting-Levin-Lischinski-Weiss-CVPR06.pdf), applied to the context of astrophotography image stacking. The code involves an extensive amount of matrix math and sparse linear system solving, done using the [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) linear algebra library.
